# Git Commands - A Comprehensive Guide

This document provides an explanation of the common Git commands used during the setup and management of Git repositories. These commands cover creating repositories, managing branches, staging files, and making commits.

---

### 1. **Initializing a Git Repository**

```bash
git init
```
- **Explanation**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This command creates a hidden `.git` directory where all configuration files and repository data will be stored.

---

### 2. **Working with Files**

#### Creating Files:

```bash
touch hello.txt
touch hello1.txt hello2.txt
```
- **Explanation**: The `touch` command creates an empty file (e.g., `hello.txt`, `hello1.txt`, `hello2.txt`). These files can then be added to Git for tracking.

#### Viewing the Directory:

```bash
ls
ls -a
```
- **Explanation**: `ls` lists the files in the current directory, while `ls -a` also shows hidden files (those starting with a dot, like `.git`).

#### Removing Files:

```bash
rm hello.txt
```
- **Explanation**: The `rm` command removes a file (e.g., `hello.txt`) from the working directory.

#### Viewing File Contents:

```bash
cat hello1.txt
```
- **Explanation**: `cat` displays the contents of a file (e.g., `hello1.txt`) in the terminal.

#### Editing Files:

```bash
vim hello.txt
```
- **Explanation**: Opens the file in the `vim` text editor for editing.

---

### 3. **Git Status**

```bash
git status
```
- **Explanation**: Displays the status of the current working directory and staging area. It shows which files are tracked, untracked, modified, or staged for commit.

---

### 4. **Staging Changes**

```bash
git add hello1.txt
git add hello2.txt
```
- **Explanation**: Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for a commit. Files need to be added to the staging area before they can be committed.

---

### 5. **Committing Changes**

```bash
git commit -m "Message"
```
- **Explanation**: Commits the staged changes to the repository. The `-m` flag allows you to add a commit message describing the changes made.

---

### 6. **Branching**

#### Creating and Managing Branches:

```bash
git branch
git checkout -b development
git branch
git checkout master
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `git branch`: Lists all branches in the current repository.
  - `git checkout -b <branch_name>`: Creates a new branch and switches to it.
  - `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switches to the specified branch (e.g., `master` or `development`).

#### Listing Branches:

```bash
git branch
```
- **Explanation**: Displays a list of branches in the current repository. The active branch is highlighted with an asterisk (`*`).

---

### 7. **Switching Between Branches**

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```
- **Explanation**: Switches to the specified branch.

```bash
git switch <branch_name>
```
- **Explanation**: An alternative command to `git checkout` for switching branches, introduced in newer versions of Git.

---

### 8. **Git Log**

```bash
git log
git log --oneline
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `git log`: Displays a detailed history of commits, showing commit IDs, messages, and dates.
  - `git log --oneline`: Displays a compact, one-line version of the commit history.

---

### 9. **Restoring Files**

```bash
git restore <file>
```
- **Explanation**: Restores a file in the working directory from the last commit, effectively discarding any uncommitted changes to that file.

---

### 10. **Unstaging Files**

```bash
git rm --cached <file>
```
- **Explanation**: Removes a file from the staging area (without deleting it from the working directory), so it will not be included in the next commit.

---

### 11. **Pushing and Pulling Changes**

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
git pull origin <branch_name>
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `git push`: Pushes your local commits to a remote repository, making them visible to others.
  - `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your current branch.

---

### 12. **Creating and Managing Directories**

```bash
mkdir <directory_name>
cd <directory_name>
cd ..
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `mkdir <directory_name>`: Creates a new directory.
  - `cd <directory_name>`: Changes the current directory to the specified one.
  - `cd ..`: Moves up one directory level.

---

### 13. **Viewing the Commit History**

```bash
git log
git log --oneline
```
- **Explanation**: These commands allow you to view the commit history. `git log --oneline` shows each commit on a single line, providing a concise view.

---

### 14. **Managing Git Configuration**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
- **Explanation**: Sets the global Git configuration for your name and email, which will be used for commits.

---

### Summary of Key Commands:

- `git init`: Initialize a new repository.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commit staged changes with a message.
- `git status`: Show the status of the repository.
- `git log`: Show commit history.
- `git branch`: List branches or create new ones.
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switch between branches.
- `git push`: Push changes to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Pull changes from the remote repository.
